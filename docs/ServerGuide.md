# Server Setup

For the server, we used DigitalOcean.

1. Create the new project.
1. Under the project, create a new droplet -- this is the server.
1. In the droplet, go to the Access menu, and Launch Console. (Or launch console through the upper right hand corner, where it says "Console")
1. It will prompt for the username and password. The username is root, and the password is emailed to you when you create the droplet. If you did not receive an email, try resetting the root password.
1. After changing the default password to your own custom password, login.
1. To add users, run `adduser <name>`, and then fill out the prompted requested information. Now they should be able to access the server.
